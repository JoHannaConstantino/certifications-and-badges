# Certifications

This folder contains professional certifications and course completions.

## How to Add Certifications

1. Create a subfolder for each platform or certification provider (e.g., `coursera/`, `udemy/`, `aws/`)
2. Add your certification files (PDFs, images, or links)
3. Update this README with a list of your certifications

## Example Structure
```
certifications/
├── coursera/
│   └── data-science-certificate.pdf
├── aws/
│   └── aws-certified-developer.pdf
└── udemy/
    └── web-development-bootcamp.pdf
```
