# Digital Badges

This folder contains digital badges earned from various platforms.

## How to Add Badges

1. Create a subfolder for each platform (e.g., `credly/`, `acclaim/`, `badgr/`)
2. Add your badge files (images, PDFs, or verification links)
3. Update this README with a list of your badges

## Example Structure
```

└── microsoft/
    └── azure-fundamentals-badge.pdf
