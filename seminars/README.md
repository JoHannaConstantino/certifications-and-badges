# Seminars and Workshops

This folder contains certificates and materials from seminars, workshops, and conferences attended.

## How to Add Seminar Materials

1. Create a subfolder for each seminar or event (e.g., `tech-conference-2024/`, `ai-workshop/`)
2. Add your certificates, presentation materials, or notes
3. Update this README with a list of seminars attended

## Example Structure

└── ai-workshop/
    └── workshop-completion.pdf
```
