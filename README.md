## üöÄ How to Add Folders

### Adding a New Category Folder

If you want to add a new category to organize your achievements:

1. **Create the folder:**
   ```bash
   mkdir folder-name
   ```

2. **Add a README.md file to the folder:**
   ```bash
   cd folder-name
   touch README.md
   ```

3. **Edit the README.md to describe the category:**
   - Explain what this folder contains
   - Provide instructions on how to add items
   - Show an example folder structure

4. **Commit your changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add new category: folder-name"
   git push
   ```

### Adding Subfolders within a Category

To organize items within a category (e.g., certifications by platform):

1. **Navigate to the category folder:**
   ```bash
   cd certifications/
   ```

2. **Create a subfolder:**
   ```bash
   mkdir platform-name
   ```

3. **Add your files:**
   ```bash
   # Copy your certificate/badge files
   cp /path/to/your/certificate.pdf platform-name/
   ```

4. **Update the category README:**
   - List your new achievement
   - Add any relevant details (date, skills, verification link)

5. **Commit your changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add [certification/badge name]"
   git push
   ```

## üí° Tips

- Use descriptive folder names (e.g., `aws-certifications`, `python-courses`)
- Include README.md files to document each folder's contents
- Consider adding verification links or QR codes in your READMEs
- Keep file names clear and consistent (e.g., `certificate-name-date.pdf`)
- Git doesn't track empty folders - add at least a README.md to each new folder

## üìö Getting Started
