# Cybersecurity Challenges

This folder contains completion certificates and write-ups from cybersecurity challenges and CTFs.

## How to Add Challenge Materials

1. Create a subfolder for each platform or event (e.g., `hackthebox/`, `tryhackme/`, `ctf-events/`)
2. Add your completion certificates, badges, or write-ups
3. Update this README with a list of challenges completed

## Example Structure

└── ctf-events/
